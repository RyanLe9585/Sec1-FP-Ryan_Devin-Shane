#For Inputing Pictures in Graphs and Plots
#You can use my data from a project as an example

#If you want me to explaing further in depth how things work in the code or something 
#doesn't work, text the GC and I'll see what I can do

#Steps
  #1. Download Packages
  #2. Download Data 
  #3. Clean the Data 
  #4. Add any new necessary Data
  #5. Filter Data to how you see fit 
  #6. Rename Columns 
  #7. Run the code to create the readPNGfromURL function 
  #8. Create you plots
  #9. Add on the remaining code that inputs images for data points
