# WAR in Baseball - STAT 184 Final Project
This repository contains data on wins above replacement (WAR) in Major League Baseball (MLB), which is weighed against statistics including offensive/defensive rating, runs allowed, and earned runs averaged (ERA) to evaluate which players are more crucial to their team's successes and which statistics are better for predicting a players WAR.

## Project Purpose
The Purpose of our project is to determine what kind of players have a high WAR. Using stats like Offensive rating and Defensive rating and comparing them to WAR, it will be determined what statistics influence the WAR number for a player the most and which have the least influnece or seemingly no influence at all.

## Repository Information
This repository has been divided into sections such that in the main folder, there is a separate folder for code files used in the project as well as a folder which contains methods for collecting data for the project. The QMD that was used to create the final submission is in the main repository folder along with the pdf of that final report that was used for submission.
