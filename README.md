# Stat 184 Final Project--Fall 2024

This repository contains data on wins above replacement (WAR) in Major League Baseball (MLB), which is weighed against statistics including offensive/defensive rating, runs allowed, and earned runs averaged (ERA) to evaluate which players are more crucial to their team's successes and which statistics are better for predicting a players WAR.

## Project Purpose
The Purpose of our project is to determine what kind of player you need to be to have a high WAR. Using stats like Offensive rating and Defensive rating, from that we will be able to determine what stats influence the WAR number for a player the most.
