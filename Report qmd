## Baseball WAR

### Introduction

The history of Baseball stats has just started to become more prominent in the 21st Century with stats like WAR, ERA, and Batting Average being the driving force to determine how great a baseball player really is. However, some of these stats can be somewhat misleading, causing you to believe that a player is a lot better than he actually is, and vice versa.

In our report, we will answer the question: What major baseball stats are the most crucial for predicting WAR? We will compare various stats to players' WAR (wins above replacement) to see which stats significantly benefit and help prove a player's importance. Also, we will compare physical player attributes (height, weight, and age) to see if they have any influence.

In this report, you will see our process of collecting the data, comparisons of stats, and an explanation of how they apply to baseball, along with conclusions based on the graphs and plots we created.



### Data Collection and Cleaning

We used various reliable data sources (ESPN, MLB.com, Baseball Savant, Baseball Reference, and FanGraphs) to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data. The dataset consists of the top 35 batters and 25 pitchers in WAR, as separating these groups provides more meaningful insights.

#### Code: Reading and Cleaning Data

```{r}
library(rvest)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(png)
library(grid)
library(ggrepel)

# Reading Data
Baseball_data <- read_html("https://www.espn.com/mlb/war/leaders")
table_data <- Baseball_data %>% 
  html_nodes("table") %>% 
  html_table(fill = TRUE)

# Cleaning Data
CleanBaseballData <- table_data[[1]] %>%
  slice(-1, -2) %>%
  rename_with(~ c("Rank", "Player", "War", "ORTG", "DRTG", "WAA", 
                  "TRPG", "ORPG", "RAA", "WAAWP"))

CleanBaseballData$War <- as.numeric(CleanBaseballData$War)
CleanBaseballData$ORTG <- as.numeric(CleanBaseballData$ORTG)
CleanBaseballData$DRTG <- as.numeric(CleanBaseballData$DRTG)

# Adding Variables
CleanBaseballData <- CleanBaseballData %>%
  mutate(Weight = c(282, 200, 209, 220, 212, 224, 215, 190, 190, 210),
         Height = c(79, 73, 76, 75, 74, 74, 72, 71, 69, 73),
         Position = c("Outfield", "Shortstop", "DH", "Shortstop", 
                      "Outfield", "Outfield", "Third Base", "Shortstop",
                      "Third Base", "Second Base"))
Hitting and Fielding Analysis

WAR vs. ORTG
The relationship between WAR and Offensive Rating (ORTG) demonstrates a strong positive correlation, suggesting that offensive performance is a significant factor in a player's overall contribution to their team.

# Plot: WAR vs. ORTG
ggplot(CleanBaseballData, aes(x = War, y = ORTG)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Relationship Between WAR and ORTG", x = "WAR", y = "ORTG") +
  theme_minimal()

WAR vs. DRTG
The relationship between WAR and Defensive Rating (DRTG) shows little to no correlation, indicating that defensive performance may not significantly affect WAR.

{r}
# Plot: WAR vs. DRTG
ggplot(CleanBaseballData, aes(x = War, y = DRTG)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Relationship Between WAR and DRTG", x = "WAR", y = "DRTG") +
  theme_minimal()

Pitching Analysis

WAR vs. ERA
The relationship between WAR and ERA shows a strong negative correlation, where pitchers with lower ERA values tend to have higher WAR, emphasizing the importance of run prevention.

# Plot: WAR vs. ERA
ggplot(CleanBaseballData, aes(x = ERA, y = War)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Relationship Between WAR and ERA", x = "ERA", y = "WAR") +
  theme_minimal()

ERA vs. FIP
The relationship between ERA and FIP shows a positive correlation, highlighting the consistency between these metrics in evaluating pitching performance.

# Plot: ERA vs. FIP
ggplot(CleanBaseballData, aes(x = FIP, y = ERA)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Relationship Between ERA and FIP", x = "FIP", y = "ERA") +
  theme_minimal()
Additional Relationships

FIP vs. Age and Height

1) Plot: FIP vs. Age
ggplot(CleanBaseballData, aes(x = Age, y = FIP)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Relationship Between FIP and Age", x = "Age", y = "FIP") +
  theme_minimal()

2) Plot: FIP vs. Height
ggplot(CleanBaseballData, aes(x = Height, y = FIP)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Relationship Between FIP and Height", x = "Height", y = "FIP") +
  theme_minimal()

Conclusion 
These were our Key Findings
Hitting and Fielding: Offensive metrics, such as ORTG and WRC+, are strong predictors of WAR. Defensive metrics like DRTG show minimal correlation.
Pitching: Metrics like ERA and FIP are closely correlated with WAR, while physical attributes like height and age do not significantly influence performance.
